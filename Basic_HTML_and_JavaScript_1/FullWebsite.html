<p><font color = "green" face = "Roboto" size = "2">A lot of WRX and STI owners decide to modify their cars and do not know how to properly go about it. Old-school, N/A wisdom dictates that intake and exhaust upgrades should be done first. Not the case with modern, ECU-driven forced induction cars.

Anecdotal evidence shows that once you upgrade to a large, free-flowing aftermarket intake on an otherwise stock STI, you get about 7-9 miles per gallon fuel mileage. Why?

When you increase amount of air going into your intake, your MAF sensor senses it and tells ECU to put more fuel through injectors. When the amount of air is increased significantly, stock MAF sensor's voltage peaks and sensor pegs cannot determine how much air is going to the engine. ECU still gets a signal to fuel more, but is not tuned and doesn?t know just how much to fuel. So it dumps huge amounts of fuel into your engine. It runs exceptionally rich, starts poorly and doesn't perform well.

Exhausts do not have such a negative effect on your fuel mileage, a good 3" turbo-back exhaust will add more power and torque, but its full potential will not be realized until other mods are done and the ECU is tuned.  </font></p>

<u><p2><font color = "#9834eb" face = "impact" size = "5">   This is a nice simple setup.  These mods address the major downfalls of the car and will greatly reduce the cruise knock and make the boost control better for overall smoother power delivery.  The IBR full TGV will provide 10-15 hp over only the upper TGV.   </font></p2></u>
